# Tooltip_React
Welcome to the React Tooltip project! This project focuses on creating a tooltip component using React that displays when a button is hovered over. The position of the tooltip can be adjusted using the "position" prop, with options including "top", "bottom", "right", and "left".

The tooltip project works on technologies like html, css and javascript, and the required React node modules .

# Problem Statement :-

The main objective of this project is to build a functional tooltip component within a React application. When a button is hovered over, the tooltip should appear at the specified position, based on the "position" prop provided.

# Project Overview :-

Tooltip Component: The heart of the project is the tooltip component, which is implemented in the Tooltip.js file. This component manages the tooltip's behavior, appearance, and position.

# Instructions :-

Clone this repository to your local machine. Install the necessary dependencies using the command npm install. Start the development server using npm start.

# Tooltip Functionality :-

Hover Interaction: When hovering over a button, the tooltip associated with that button should be displayed. Positioning: The tooltip's position is determined by the "position" prop provided. Available options are "top", "bottom", "right", and "left".

# Usage :-

Locate the button with the tooltip that you'd like to interact with. Hover over the button to trigger the tooltip's appearance. The tooltip will be displayed based on the specified position ("top", "bottom", "right", or "left").


## Installation

## Libraries and tools

This app was built using **Create React App**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Router**, **Redux Persist**, **React Icons**, **Recharts** and **Class Names** library.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

##  Deployment
